# MicroOffice to integrate singleton into abstract factory pattern

This software is designed to test the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of four generations of MicroOffice Word Processing Applications: Word90, Word00, Word10, and Word21. These applications have different GUI components (Panel, Button, and Textbox) that may look different in each generation. To automate the testing process and determine which tests to run, we use a configuration file (text file) that specifies which generations of Word to test.


## Compilation and Run Application
    Step 1->Go to src folder
    Step 2->Compile the Java Source Code: javac *.java
    Step 3->Run the application: java WordGenerationApp

## Source Code File Descriptions

This section provides an overview of the key source code files.

### Main/Entry Point Class

- `WordGenerationApp.java`: This is the main class of the application, serving as the entry point.

### Classes:
- 'SingletonAndFactoryProducer': evaluates singleton and is producer for factory objects
- 'AbstractWordFactory': This is an abstract class that serves as the foundation for creating Word Processing Application GUI components such as panels, textboxes, and buttons for different generations of Word applications
-'Word90Factory', 'Word00Factory', 'Word10Factory', 'Word21Factory': These classes are a concrete implementation of the AbstractWordFactory
- 'AbstractButton' ,'AbstractPanel', 'AbstractTextbox': These class are an abstract class that defines the blueprint for creating word components(button, panel, textbox ) within the Word Processing Application GUI. It serves as a foundation for implementing concrete component classes for different Word generations (e.g., Word90, Word00, Word10, Word21).

### Test Data Files

- `generation.txt`: includes list of generations for testing the application
